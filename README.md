## Summary

METROBEAT is the world's first gamified Spotify playlist maker! Users sign in with his/her Spotify username and password. Upon account creation, METROBEAT creates a new playlist in the user's Spotify account. Players search for and choose their favorite songs. Next, they guess the Beats Per Minute of that song. When they guess correctly, that song is added to their new playlist and can play again.

## How to Use METROBEAT

Sign in with your valid Spotify account. Search for a song you love. Once you've found it, give it a click to begin the game. Listen to the song and try to count the Beats per Minute. When you guess right, METROBEAT will add that song to your playlist, and you can search for another song.

## Known Bugs
